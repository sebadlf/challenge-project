# Challenge Project

Install dependencies using ```npm install```

Run the app with ```npm start```

## Possible UX improvements

- There is no loading indication. It's specially nedded since the backend implementation is really slow.
- Keyboard interaction could be added.
- Since the backend is error prone, errors management sould be defined as part of the UX.
